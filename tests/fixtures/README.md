# Test Fixtures

These fixtures are for test-only use and are not part of the distributed reference data in `src/euring/data`.
They are intentionally empty placeholders so teams can drop in local test data without committing it.

## Fixtures

**euring2000_fixture.txt**
Empty placeholder for EURING2000 sample data.

**euring2000plus_fixture.psv**
